	<p><strong>Reflections:</strong></p>

	<p> So I've basically come into this one late and cold.  I was a late addition to the class 
	and all the class stuff did not show up for me in Canvas until Jan 4th!  I have not done any 
	HTML really until now and I was thinking this had to be done by Jan 5th. Soooo, It's been a 
	"drinking from the fire hose" type experience. All in all though, I think I've got it right.
	I didn't find the textbook online till late Saturday so I was using google and the lecture 
	demo etc to figure stuff out. Aaannnd I just couldn't help myself.  I did manage to get the
	"Personal Details" section aligned.  But it looks horrible in code.  I'm betting using CSS 
	would be much nicer from a code readability point as well as ease of doing it!<br>
	Interestingly, the main pain for this assignment was trying to figure out how github worked 
	and how	to get it to have directories inside a depository. Well enough from me, here is the
	link to the assignment.
