Problems:

1. Cell borders, as shown in the assignment picture, could only be done using the <style> tag which I sadly believe qualifies
as CSS.  I left this in my main submission because I felt it was important to be able to see the cells and cell merging:

<style>
        th, td {
            border: 1px solid white;
            border-spacing: 0px;
        }
</style>

2. Using valign and align inside a <td> tag is considered "obsolete" by the validator.  
Since we are not supposed to use a bunch of CSS, I could not find any other way to correctly format a number of cells
per the formatting shown in the example picture.  The primary assignment submission passes the validator but 
does not have the same alignment formating as the picture of the table we were to reproduce.

3.  I have included a secondary submission which has the correct alignment formatting in all cells but
does not pass the validator check for reasons noted in #2 above.
