	<p><strong>Reflections:</strong></p>

	<p> I decided to download the images used here rather than supply the links since who knows 
	if they'd still be there later.  (well ok, you would think they would but still..) Since it's
	just after the holidays, I decided to throw down some of my fave holiday treats. :-) <br>
	
	As far as the assignment went, no real problems.
