	<p><strong>Reflections:</strong></p>

	<p> I decided to download the images used for this assignment rather than supply the links in <br>
	the code for them since who knows if they'd still be there later.  (well ok, you would think <br>
	they would and I DID use the full links for the recipe pages but still..) <br>
	Since it's just after the holidays, I decided to throw down some of my fave holiday treats. :-) <br>
	
	As far as the assignment went, no real problems.
